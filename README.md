# Purchase Request System
Internship Project

Except for the design of the index or login page, I personally developed all the code in this project. The main goal of this project was to facilitate the comfortable printing of purchase request documents, eliminating the need to manually enter purchase details in MS Excel. While the project has been successfully completed, I acknowledge that there is ample room for improvement, particularly due to the absence of guidance from someone with more experience. Nevertheless, I take pride in my work, and the project has provided me with valuable experience.
